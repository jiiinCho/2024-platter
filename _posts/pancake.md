title: "Fluffy, Not Floppy"
excerpt: "Best Homemade Pancake. This homemade pancake recipe, adapted from The New York Times Cookbook by Craig Claiborne, has been a beloved staple in my kitchen since my kids were little, and for good reason. Made with ingredients I always have hand—like flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, milk, eggs, and butter—the pancakes have the perfect texture: fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside."

## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 egg

## Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1.** Combine the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a bowl. Mix well then combine the eggs and milk in a bowl. Whisk to combine.

**Step 2.** Pour the milk mixture and the melted butter into the dry ingredients. Stir just enough to moisten the flour mixture. It should look a little lumpy. (If you overwork the mixture, the pancakes will be tough.) This is a thick batter but if it seems too thick, add a bit more milk.

**Step 3.** Heat a griddle or large nonstick pan over medium heat; coat it lightly with vegetable oil and swirl in a thin pat of butter. Ladle the batter onto the skillet, using about ¼ cup for each pancake; cook until the first side is golden brown, or until the top surface bubbles and is dotted with holes. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown. _**This happens quickly so peek after 30 seconds and watch carefully!**_ Adjust the heat setting if necessary.

**Step 4.** Wipe the griddle totally clean with a paper towel between batches. Serve immediately with maple syrup and a pat of butter, if desired.
